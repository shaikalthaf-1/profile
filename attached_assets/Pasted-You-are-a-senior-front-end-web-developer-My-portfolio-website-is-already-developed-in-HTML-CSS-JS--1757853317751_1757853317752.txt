You are a senior front-end web developer. My portfolio website is already developed in HTML/CSS/JS, but I want to improve and expand it. Update the code for index.html, styles.css, and script.js to be production-ready, modern, and professional.

Required improvements:

1. Founder & CEO Page:
   - Create two dedicated pages:
     • Skill IT Hub (Founder & CEO profile): Highlight Shaik Althaf’s expertise in AI and cloud automation, his vision for student upskilling, and his commitment to connecting learners with job opportunities. Tone: professional and inspiring.
     • MacroCloud (Founder & CEO profile): Highlight multi-cloud expertise, simplifying cloud infrastructure, and MacroCloud’s unique features (deploy, automate, manage, migrate across AWS/Azure/GCP in one interface). Tone: professional and forward-thinking.
   - Add navigation links to these pages from the main menu.

2. Portfolio / Case Studies:
   - Redesign the Portfolio/Case Studies section into responsive project cards.
   - Each card should include: project title, short description, tags (Cloud, AI, DevOps, etc.), and a “Read More” option to expand or link to a detailed page.
   - Example projects: Cloud Automation Framework, Multi-cloud Migration Case Study, AI-driven Infrastructure Monitoring.

3. General Improvements (production-ready):
   - Optimize site for responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Improve accessibility (semantic HTML, alt tags for images, ARIA roles if needed).
   - Add smooth animations/transitions for navigation and hover effects.
   - Add SEO-friendly meta tags and Open Graph tags for better sharing on LinkedIn/Twitter.
   - Ensure fast load times (optimize CSS/JS structure).
   - Professional color palette, consistent typography, clean spacing.

Deliverables:
- index.html (homepage with updated portfolio section + links to new pages)
- skillithub.html (dedicated page for Skill IT Hub)
- macrocloud.html (dedicated page for MacroCloud)
- styles.css (refined for responsiveness, animations, production)
- script.js (smooth navigation, expandable case study cards, animations if required)

Make the output neat, responsive, and production-ready.
